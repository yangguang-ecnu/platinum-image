Image analysis platform based on ITK, VTK and FLTK.

The platform aims at:
  * Simplifying collaborations in image processing research
  * Reducing the development time and effort, allowing scientists to focus on their research
  * Reusing image processing code from various applications

A matrix-style user interface displays the image data. Image processing procedures are easy defined. Various input and output image formats are supported.

The current main focus of the platform is on processing of 3D image data.
