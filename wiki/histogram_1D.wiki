#summary Description of the one-dimensional templated frequency histogram
#labels Phase-Implementation,ClassDescription

= Purpose=
*histogram_1D* calculates the following information from an image:
 * A frequency histogram with an adjustable number of buckets
 * The number of discrete values (only when # of buckets is >= number of possible discrete values)
 * Minimum and maximum values

The input can be either an image_storage (or derived class) or a pointer to image data (including a pointer to the end of this data). In the latter case it is important to match the template argument for histogram_1D<type> with the type of the image data.

A histogram_1D is attached to each [image_storage] object to provide stastics for use when displaying and processing the image.

*NOTE:* The bucket_max value (used for display) _ignores values 0 and 1_ because these are the most common by far in many images. This is intentional in order to get a sensible scaling when displaying the histogram.
