_Inherits [point_collection]_

`point` is the class for single points, like seed points and such. It has `point_collection` as parent and thus can use any operation that is possible on any number of points (not those, however, that specifically need > 1 point). 

`get_orientation ()` function returns the object's single point as a Vector3D.
