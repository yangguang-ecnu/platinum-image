The Platinum project started at the [Image- and function center of Uppsala university hospital](http://www.radiol.uu.se/) and is now being further developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca.

In hospital and corporate clinical imaging environments, image processing algorithm development tends to be a multi-stage cycle, where several steps are required to evaluate each change in the developing software. The steps include coding, compiling, execution – which may comprise multiple steps including specifying arguments – and evaluation by using a separate image viewer. The imaging platform is intended to aid these research projects in reducing the development cycle time and effort, allowing scientists to focus on their research.

## Technology ##
The Platinum library is written in C++, using templates and many components of the Standard Template Library. It is intended to operate in Linux, Windows and Mac OS X environments and is built using CMake.
